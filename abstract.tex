\begin{abstract}
We give upper bounds on the number of crossing-free straight-edge perfect matchings on a set of $n$ points
with designated left and right endpoints for some configurations of the designated endpoints.
These configurations are characterized by the left-to-right order of the left and right endpoints projected on the
horizontal.
When all left endpoints lie to the left of the right endpoints (matchings across a line),
we give an upper bound dependent on the number of extreme points. In particular, when
half the points are extreme, there are at most $\BigO\of{2.6^n}$ crossing-free perfect matchings across a line.
When the designated endpoints form four blocks, from left to right, left endpoints, then right endpoints, left endpoints,
and finally right endpoints, there are at most $\BigO\of{5^n}$ crossing-free perfect matching. We also give a bound dependent
on the size of the blocks.
