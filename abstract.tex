\begin{abstract}
We give upper bounds on the number of crossing-free straight-edge perfect matchings on a set of $n$ points
with designated left and right endpoints for some left-to-right orderings of the designated endpoints.
When all left endpoints lie to the left of the right endpoints (matchings across a line),
we give an upper bound dependent on the number of extreme points. In particular, when
half the points are extreme, there are at most $\BigO\of{2.6^n}$ crossing-free perfect matchings across a line.
When the designated endpoints form four blocks, left-right-left-right, there are at most $\BigO\of{5^n}$
crossing-free perfect matchings.
